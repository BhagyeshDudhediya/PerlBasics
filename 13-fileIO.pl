# Other way (one line code) to read an entire file. This is called slurp mode.
# The $/ variable is the Input Record Separator in Perl. When we put the read-line operator in scalar context,
# for example by assigning to a scalar variable $data = <DST>, perl will read from the file up-to and including the Input Record Separator which is,
# by default, the new-line \n.
# What we did here is we assigned undef to $/. So the read-line operator will read the file up-till the first time it encounters undef in the file.
# That never happens so it reads till the end of the file. This is what is called slurp mode, because of the sound the file makes when we read it.
# The big problem with the above code is that $/ is a global variable. This if we change $/ in one place of our code, this will change the behavior of perl in# other places of our code and even in third-party modules. So it is better to localize it:

seek(DST, 0, 0);
$/ = undef;
$data = <DST>;
print "\n\URead through slurp way:\n$data\n";

close DATA || die "Couldn't close file !!";
close DST || die "Couldn't close file !!";
